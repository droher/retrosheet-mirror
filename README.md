# retrosheet-mirror

This repo is a mirror of the [alldata.zip file](https://www.retrosheet.org/downloads/alldata.zip) on Retrosheet's website. It specifically exists to help with Retrosheet's QA process and is not meant for broad public consumption. For a reliabily-maintained copy, I recommend using the [Chadwick Bureau's Retrosheet repo](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/retrosheet) or accessing the data from Retrosheet's site directly.
